	abstract = {Patterns with wildcards in specified positions, namely spaced seeds, are increasingly used instead of k-mers in many bioinformatics applications that require indexing, querying and rapid similarity search, as they can provide better sensitivity. Many of these applications require to compute the hashing of each position in the input sequences with respect to the given spaced seed, or to multiple spaced seeds. While the hashing of k-mers can be rapidly computed by exploiting the large overlap between consecutive k-mers, spaced seeds hashing is usually computed from scratch for each position in the input sequence, thus resulting in slower processing.},

	abstract = {Alignment-free classification of sequences has enabled high-throughput processing of sequencing data in many bioinformatics pipelines. Much work has been done to speed up the indexing of k-mers through hash-table and other data structures. These efforts have led to very fast indexes, but because they are k-mer based, they often lack sensitivity due to sequencing errors or polymorphisms. Spaced seeds are a special type of pattern that accounts for errors or mutations. They allow to improve the sensitivity and they are now routinely used instead of k-mers in many applications. The major drawback of spaced seeds is that they cannot be efficiently hashed and thus their usage increases substantially the computational time. In this article we address the problem of efficient spaced seed hashing. We propose an iterative algorithm that combines multiple spaced seed hashes by exploiting the similarity of adjacent hash values to efficiently compute the next hash. We report a series of experiments on HTS reads hashing, with several spaced seeds. Our algorithm can compute the hashing values of spaced seeds with a speedup in range of [3.5 × -7 × ], outperforming previous methods. Software and data sets are available at Iterative Spaced Seed Hashing.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Analysis of organism-specific interactomes has yielded novel insights into cellular function and coordination, understanding of pathology, and identification of markers and drug targets. Genes, however, can exhibit varying levels of cell type specificity in their expression, and their coordinated expression manifests in tissue-specific function and pathology. Tissue-specific/tissue-selective interaction mechanisms have significant applications in drug discovery, as they are more likely to reveal drug targets. Furthermore, tissue-specific transcription factors (tsTFs) are significantly implicated in human disease, including cancers. Finally, disease genes and protein complexes have the tendency to be differentially expressed in tissues in which defects cause pathology. These observations motivate the construction of refined tissue-specific interactomes from organism-specific interactomes.Results: We present a novel technique for constructing human tissue-specific interactomes. Using a variety of validation tests (Edge Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Ontology Enrichment, Disease-Gene Subnetwork Compactness), we show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, using case studies of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, we show that tissue-specific interactomes derived from our study can be used to construct pathways implicated in pathology and demonstrate the use of these pathways in identifying novel targets.Availability and implementation:  http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/mohammas/projects/ActPro.htmlContact:  mohammadi@purdue.edu},

	abstract = {Motivation: Counting the number of occurrences of every k-mer (substring of length k) in a long string is a central subproblem in many applications, including genome assembly, error correction of sequencing reads, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm.Results: We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems. For the task of k-mer counting, important in many biological applications, Jellyfish offers a much faster and more memory-efficient solution.Availability: The Jellyfish software is written in C++ and is GPL licensed.

These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and near-term challenges include the development of robust protocols for generating sequencing libraries, building effective new approaches to data-analysis, and often a rethinking of experimental design. Next-generation DNA sequencing has the potential to dramatically accelerate biological and biomedical research, by enabling the comprehensive analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and interactomes to become inexpensive, routine and widespread, rather than requiring significant production-scale efforts.},

A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V−SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online (http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades). It is distributed as open source software.}

The particular choice of the seed length, k, is determined by the tradeoff between search speed (larger k reduces chance hits) and sensitivity (smaller k finds weaker similarities). A novel idea of using a single deterministic optimized spaced seed was introduced in Ma et al. (Bioinformatics (2002) 18) to the above similarity search process and it was empirically demonstrated that the optimal spaced seed quadruples the search speed, without sacrificing sensitivity. Multiple, randomly spaced patterns, spaced q-grams, and spaced probes were also studied in Califano and Rigoutsos (Technical Report, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center (1995), Burkhardt, Kärkkäinen, CPM (2001), and Buhler, Bioinformatics 17 (2001) 419) and in other applications [(RECOMB (1999) 295, RECOMB (2000) 245)]. They were all found to be better than their contiguous counterparts. In this paper we study some of the theoretical and practical aspects of optimal seeds. In particular we demonstrate that the commonly used contiguous seed is in some sense the worst one, and we offer an algorithmic solution to the problem of finding the optimal seed.}

Often, the construction of ultra-fast and precise taxonomic classifiers can compromise on their sensitivity (i.e. the number of reads correctly classified).

	abstract = {The growing number of sequencing projects in medicine and environmental sciences is creating new computational demands in the analysis and processing of these very large datasets. Recently we have proposed an algorithm called MetaProb that can accurately cluster metagenomic reads with a precision that is currently unmatched. The competitive advantage of MetaProb depends on the use of sequence signatures based on contiguous k-mers. Instead of using contiguous k-mers, in this work we explore the use of spaced seeds where mismatches are allowed at carefully predetermined positions. The experimental results show that the use of mismatches can further improve the accuracy and decrease the memory requirements. Availability: https://bitbucket.org/samu661/metaprob.}

	abstract = {Motivation: Alignment-free methods for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome analysis and phylogeny reconstruction; they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment-based approaches. In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent. Results: To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use ‘spaced words’, defined by patterns of ‘match’ and ‘don’t care’ positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words.

	abstract = {Many algorithms for sequence analysis rely on word matching or word statistics. Often, these approaches can be improved if binary patterns representing match and don’t-care positions are used as a filter, such that only those positions of words are considered that correspond to the match positions of the patterns. The performance of these approaches, however, depends on the underlying patterns. Herein, we show that the overlap complexity of a pattern set that was introduced by Ilie and Ilie is closely related to the variance of the number of matches between two evolutionarily related sequences with respect to this pattern set. We propose a modified hill-climbing algorithm to optimize pattern sets for database searching, read mapping and alignment-free sequence comparison of nucleic-acid sequences; our implementation of this algorithm is called rasbhari. Depending on the application at hand, rasbhari can either minimize the overlap complexity of pattern sets, maximize their sensitivity in database searching or minimize the variance of the number of pattern-based matches in alignment-free sequence comparison. We show that, for database searching, rasbhari generates pattern sets with slightly higher sensitivity than existing approaches. In our Spaced Words approach to alignment-free sequence comparison, pattern sets calculated with rasbhari led to more accurate estimates of phylogenetic distances than the randomly generated pattern sets that we previously used. Finally, we used rasbhari to generate patterns for short read classification with CLARK-S. Here too, the sensitivity of the results could be improved, compared to the default patterns of the program. We integrated rasbhari into Spaced Words; the source code of rasbhari is freely available at http://rasbhari.gobics.de/},
