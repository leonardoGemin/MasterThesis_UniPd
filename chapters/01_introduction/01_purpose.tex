\section{Purpose of the thesis}
\label{sec:thesis-purpose}

The main objective of this thesis is to develop advanced software that efficiently computes forward hashing and reverse complement hashing for spaced $k$-mer in nucleotide sequences. This software is designed to improve the handling and analysis of the large amounts of genetic data generated by modern \acs{DNA} sequencing techniques. Another crucial goal is to optimise the speed and computational efficiency of the hashing process. Considering the increasing size of genomic datasets, it is crucial to have tools that can perform fast analyses without compromising accuracy. The software developed will have to be able to handle these volumes of data efficiently, minimising the processing time and computational resources required. In addition, the software will have to be tested on various datasets to evaluate its performance in comparison to existing tools. This includes a detailed analysis of execution times and a comparison with other hashing techniques currently in use.
