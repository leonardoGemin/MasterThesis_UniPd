\noindent
This document was produced using the document preparation system \LaTeX, a powerful typesetting suite particularly suitable for academic and scientific documents. The bibliography was edited with the \texttt{biblatex} package, in combination with Biber as a backend for bibliographic reference management.

Robert Slimbach’s Warnock Pro acts as both the text and display typeface. Sans-serif text is typeset in Slimbach and Carol Twombly’s \textsf{Myriad Pro}; monospaced text uses Howard Kettler’s \texttt{Courier New}.
