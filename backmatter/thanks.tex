At the end of this academic journey, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to mum and dad and my grandparents, my endless thanks for their unconditional love and support. Thank you for teaching me the value of commitment, dedication and sacrifice. You have always believed in my abilities, even when I myself doubted that I could do it. Your constant presence and words of encouragement have been an inexhaustible source of strength for me.

To my brother Giacomo, thank you for always being by my side. Your presence and support have been crucial, especially in the most difficult moments.

To all my family, for their constant affection and support. Thank you for believing in me and always encouraging me to follow my dreams. You have been a fundamental pillar in this journey.

To my friends, whose friendship has made this journey lighter and more joyful. Thank you for the laughter, the advice and for being a source of positive energy.
